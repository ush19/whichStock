GOAL
build application to evaluate and recommend companies for investing

INSPIRATION
Challenge to expand Python skills to build a sort of mathematical model and recommendation system to recommend companies from calculated metrics, inspired from Mary Buffett’s Interpretation of Financial Statements + more abstract factors/features to figure out

INITIAL THOUGHTS
From Checklist Manifesto (Atul Gawande): 
REMEMBER: checklist is not a formula
“It’s easy to hide in the statements. It’s hard to hide between statements.”
To find underrecognized, undervalued companies (value investing)
    - ex. “buy Coca-cola before everyone realizes it’s going to be Coca-Cola”
    - CHECK: research + good deal + invest for the long run
    - CHECK: financial reports + liabilities, risk + management’s track record + competitor analysis + future of industry
    - CHECK: leverage = borrowed + actual cash + riskiness of debts
    - CHECK: if revenue is overstated or understated and if it’s due to boom or bust conditions (i.e., if it’s temporary)
    - CHECK: footnotes on Cash Flow statement
    - CHECK: statement of key management risk
    - CHECK: if cash flow and costs matches reported revenue growth

INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Market API: 
    financialmodelingprep (FMP) - Yearly Starter Plan ($10.50/month)
Use FMP to gather all metrics mentioned in [1] for analysis and comparison
Develop formulae from [1] to determine if good to suggest
Develop mathematical model to score when compared against other companies
VERIFY: Buffett only compares companies in the same industry - develop script to gather stocks when mentioned in the same article or in the same industry and cap size
