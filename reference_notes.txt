(WB - INTERPRETATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
[3] How to ID a company with a durable competitive advantage? 
[3] How to value a company with durable competitive advantage? 
[6] Benjamin Graham (BG) bought high-value, under-priced companies and sell at profit ("value investing")
[8] WB found out that comapnies which had DCA were ones that created monopolies - enabling the company to control the price of the product 
[10] WB focused on investments where risk was low and potential for gain was high
[12] three basic business models to look for: 
        1. sell unique product/service 
        (Products: Coca Cola, Pepsi, Wrigley, Hershey, Budweiser, Coors, Kraft, The Washington Post, Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris) - the public unconsciously and naturally think of these products, they "own a piece of the consumer's mind"
        (Services: Moody's Corp, H&R Block, American Express, The Service Master, Wells Fargo) - the public needs them as institutions and services are for everyone, needed by everyone. 
        2. low-cost buyer and seller of a product/service
                +
        3. service that the public consistently needs 
        (WalMart, Costco, Nebraska Furniture Mart) - big margins for volume 
[17] consistency is key. CONSISTENT DURABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE is what's key. Consistency in metrics from the financial statements. 
[18] Income Statement generated quarterly and annually
[19] Balance Sheet generated quarterly and annually
[19] Cash Flow Statement generated annually
[21] 10Q: quarterly financial statements
[21] 10K: annual report (annually reported financial statements)
[27] FROM INCOME STATEMENT: 
    margins
    R&D spend 
    leverage to make money
    importance of source of earnings > importance of earnings 
    
    

(SP - SELF NOTES)
KEY METRIC: 
    DCA = Durable Competitive Advantage
        - this will be the metric to score companies: DCA_SCORE
        
METRICS: 
    [28][INCOME STATEMENT][REVENUE][COST OF GOODS SOLD]: 
        RELABELED AS GROSS PROFIT
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ Determine if company is earning profit: 
            GROSS PROFIT = PROFIT = TOTAL REVENUE - EXPENSES = TOTAL REVENUE - COGS 
        INTERPRETATION: 
            higher, the better

    [30][INCOME STATEMENT][COST OF GOODS SOLD]:
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖüö® not so helpful by itself
        BUT should know how a company is deriving this number

    [32][INCOME STATEMENT][REVENUE][COST OF GOODS SOLD]:
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ High GPM allows company to increase the price of products/services way more than the COGS, compared to other companies
        GROSS PROFIT MARGIN = GPM = 
            = GROSS PROFIT / TOTAL REVENUE
            = (TOTAL REVENUE - EXPENSES) / TOTAL REVENUE
            = (TOTAL REVENUE - COGS) / TOTAL REVENUE
        INTERPRETATION: 
            best time frame: last 10 years 
            if company *consistently* has higher gross profit margin than other companies
            Companies with >= 40% GPM have DCA 
            Companies with < 40% GPM are in highly competitive industries
            Companies with <= 20% GPM are in fiercely competitive industries 
        DOWNSIDE: 
            WB stays away from tech companies
                ex. MSFT has GPM of 79% while AAPL has GPM  of 31%

    [36][INCOME STATEMENT][OPERATING EXPENSES][GROSS PROFIT]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ Operating expenses (OpEx) includes R&D, SG&A, depreciative, amortization, and other.
        OPERATING PROFIT OR LOSS = 
            = GROSS PROFIT - OPERATING EXPENSES
            = (REVENUE - COGS) - OPERATING EXPENSES
            = (REVENUE - COGS) - (SG&A + R&D + DEPRECIATION + OTHER)
        INTERPRETATION: 
            (?) best to have consistently positive, high operating P/L

    [38][INCOME STATEMENT][SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES][GROSS PROFIT]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ SG&A includes costs for direct and indirect selling expenses and all general and admin. expenses during accounting period. Also includes management salaries, advertising, travel costs, legal fees, commissions, all payroll costs, etc. 
        Calculated as a percentage of gross profit
        Consistency is key
        INTERPRETATION:
            Lower, the better. Consistently low, even better
            Companies with < 30%: fantastic DCA
            Companies between 30% and 80%: DCA
            Companies consistently close to or above 100%: no DCA (highly competitive industry)
            
            Companies with high R&D can be bad SOMETIMES, even with DCA 
            
            MUST compare against R&D costs, capital expenditure and debt
            
            report as is and as a percentage of gross profit
            
    [42][INCOME STATEMENT][RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT][GROSS PROFIT]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ WB doesn't like companies which consistently spend and especially spend high percentages of R&D costs from gross profit. 
        INTERPRETATION: 
            little to nil R&D costs is preferable, consistently
            record as amount and percentage of gross profit
        
    [45][INCOME STATEMENT][DEPRECIATION][OPERATING PROFIT]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖüö® Note: EBITDA - Earnings Before Income Tax, Depreciation, Amortization = used since companies report earnings which are decreased from the depreciation 
        INTERPRETATION:
            little to nil depreciation is preferable, consistently
            record as amount and percentage of gross profit/operating profit
            
        Amortization included in Depreciation amount and label. Concern? 
        
    [49][INCOME STATEMENT][INTEREST EXPENSE][OPERATING PROFIT]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ Defined as the interest paid out, during the quarter or year, on the debt the company carries on its balance sheet as a liability. 
        INTERPRETATION:
            little to no interest expense is preferable, consistently 
            interest expense of less than 15% operating income is WB's rule in consumer products category. this varies in various industries. 
            in any given industry, the company with the lowest ratio of interest expense to operating income is the company with DCA. 
            
            record as amount and percentage of operating income / operating profit
            
            
    [53][INCOME STATEMENT][GAIN/(LOSS) SALE ASSETS, OTHER]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ non-recurring events so should NOT be taken into account
        INTERPRETATION: 
            NOT USED
        
    [55][INCOME STATEMENT][INCOME BEFORE TAX]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ This figure should actually be used when comparing companies. 
        INTERPRETATION: 
            interpret as is
            
            record as is
            
    [57][INCOME STATEMENT][INCOME TAXES PAID]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖüö® this number is derived from when taxes are paid 
        INTERPRETATION: 
            if: 
                [INCOME BEFORE TAX] - ([INCOME BEFORE TAX] * 0.35) != [INCOME TAXES PAID]
            then:
                flag BAD
            else:
                flag GOOD
        
        
    [59][INCOME STATEMENT][NET EARNINGS]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖüö® Net Earnings = Income Before Tax - Income Taxes Paid 
        INTERPRETATION:
            historical, consistent upward trend is highly preferable
            ratio between net earnings to total revenue should be high. Generally speaking (with exceptions): 
                > 20%, consistently: long term competitive advantage
                < 10%, consistently: highly competitive industry
                between 10% - 20%: possibly good that no one has discovered yet? EXPLORE
                
            EXCEPTION: banks and financial companies have high net earnings to revenue which are not what they seem - maybe excuse this metric for banks and financial companies
                
    [63][INCOME STATEMENT][NET EARNINGS]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ Per-Share Earnings = Net Earnings / Outstanding Shares
        INTERPRETATION: 
            historical, consistent upward trend is highly preferable
            
    [69][BALANCE SHEET]
        ‚úÖ Shows how much the company has in assets and how much money it owes 
        Two parts:
            (1) assets: 
                    cash, receivables, inventory, property, plant, equipment
            (2) liabilities 
                    Current Liabilities:
                        money owed within the year (A/P, Accrued Expenses, Short-Term Debt, Long-Term Debt)
                    Long-term liabilities:
                        due in one year or more as well as money owed to vendors 
                shareholders equity
                    = net worth of business = assets - liabilities
                    
    [72][BALANCE SHEET][ASSETS]
        ‚úÖ Total Assets = cash, plant and equipment, patents. 
        2 categories make up Total Assets:
            (1) Current Assets: cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, net receivables, inventory, other assets 
                Can be converted into cash, usually, within a year
                Listed in order of liquidity (high to low) 
            (2) All Other Assets: 
                Long-term investments, property plant and equipment, Goodwill, intangible assets, accumulated amortization, other assets, deferred long term asset charges 
                Cannot be converted into cash within a year
                    
    [75][BALANCE SHEET][CURRENT ASSETS]
        ‚úÖ Current assets = working assets: cash going into buying inventory
            Current assets: Cash --> inventory --> Accounts Receivable --> Cash
            
    [77][BALANCE SHEET][CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT]
        ‚òëÔ∏è‚úÖ Low amount of cash means poor economics of a company
        Huge amounts of cash is a good thing
        
        Ways to create cash: 
            1. sell new bonds or equity to the public
            2. sell existing business or other assets that the company owns
            3. ongoing business than generates more cash than it burns
            
        INTERPRETATION: 
            Look at company's past 7 years of balance sheets. 
            If a company's DCA is about to disappear, look at how much cash they have.
                If high cash and low debt, it's ok - HOLD. 
                
                    
    [171][WHEN TO BUY]
        No certain time about when to buy
        But when NOT to buy: at the height of bull markets, when they have historically high price-to-earnings ratio
        
    [173][WHEN TO SELL]
        - no matter what, sell ONLY after one year of holding investment
        - sell when money is needed for another investment with better returns 
        - sell when DCA is about to disappear
        - sell when in a bull market and everyone's buying
            this sends price high and crash harder
        - sell when PE ratio of 40 or more
        
FEATURES: 
    options to method of investing, ex. Graham, Buffett, Palakurthi, mix(?)
    whether to invest or not after comparison 
        not WHEN to invest - as long as stock price kept raising, any fair price is OK to invest at
    when to exit investment
    with WB method, avoid capital gains tax by holding for a minimum of 366 days
    incorporate BG's tactics: 
        buy high-value, under-priced companies in any industry
        sell at profit
        companies trading less than hald of what they held in cash
        never pay more than 10 times a company's earnings 
        if up 50%, sell
        if not up 50% and 2 years have passed, sell

    (Dec 16 2022) To track consistency, use series of regression models and use statistics to confirm consistency
    (Dec 16 2022) After thinking about it... there's probably a better way to take all the values of the quarterly and annual pandas dataframe and transform them into the columns I need than doing the calculations one by one - to implement after this iteration
    (Dec 16 2022) Amortization is included with Depreciation - will this be an issue? 
    (Dec 16 2022) [57] amount from the calculation will never be exact so need a gray range to estimate if good or bad
    (Dec 16 2022) [57] "The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made several large changes to business taxes, including permanently lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent"
